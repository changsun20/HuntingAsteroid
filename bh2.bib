	abstract = {AbstractWe review the properties and behavior of 20 X-ray binaries that contain a dynamically-confirmed black hole, 17 of which are transient systems. During the past decade, many of these transient sources were observed daily throughout the course of their typically year-long outburst cycles using the large-area timing detector aboard the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100–450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide. We sketch a scenario for the potential impact of timing/spectral studies of accreting black holes on physics and discuss a current frontier topic, namely, the measurement of black hole spin.},

	abstract = {The spin of a black hole is an important quantity to study, providing a window into the processes by which a black hole was born and grew. Furthermore, spin can be a potent energy source for powering relativistic jets and energetic particle acceleration. In this review, I describe the techniques currently used to detect and measure the spins of black holes. It is shown that: ▪ Two well-understood techniques, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and thermal continuum fitting, can be used to measure the spins of black holes that are accreting at moderate rates. There is a rich set of other electromagnetic techniques allowing us to extend spin measurements to lower accretion rates. ▪ Many accreting supermassive black holes are found to be rapidly spinning, although a population of more slowly spinning black holes emerges at masses above as expected from recent structure formation models. ▪ Many accreting stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems are rapidly spinning and must have been born in this state. ▪ The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has enabled the detection of spin effects in merging binary black holes. Most of the premerger black holes are found to be slowly spinning, a notable exception being an object that may itself be a merger product. ▪ The stark difference in spins between the black hole X-ray binary and the binary black hole populations shows that there is a diversity of formation mechanisms. Given the array of new electromagnetic and gravitational wave capabilities currently being planned, the future of black hole spin studies is bright.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new library of 535,194 model images of the supermassive black holes and Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) targets Sgr A* and M87*, computed by performing general relativistic radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Then, to infer underlying black hole and accretion flow parameters (spin, inclination, ion-to-electron temperature ratio, and magnetic field polarity), we train a random forest machine learning model on various hand-picked polarimetric observables computed from each image. Our random forest is capable of making meaningful predictions of spin, inclination, and the ion-to-electron temperature ratio, but has more difficulty inferring magnetic field polarity. To disentangle how physical parameters are encoded in different observables, we apply two different metrics to rank the importance of each observable at inferring each physical parameter. Details of the spatially resolved linear polarization morphology stand out as important discriminators between models. Bearing in mind the theoretical limitations and incompleteness of our image library, for the real M87* data, our machinery favours high-spin retrograde models with large ion-to-electron temperature ratios. Due to the time-variable nature of these targets, repeated polarimetric imaging will further improve model inference as the EHT and next-generation (EHT) continue to develop and monitor their targets.},

	abstract = {The spins of black holes in merging binaries can reveal information related to the formation and evolution of these systems. Combining events to infer the astrophysical distribution of black hole spins allows us to determine the relative contribution from different formation scenarios to the population. Many previous works have modeled spin population distributions using parametric models. While these are valuable approaches when the observed population is small, they make strong assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution and are highly susceptible to biases due to mismodeling. The results obtained with such parametric models are only valid if the allowed shape of the distribution is well-motivated (i.e. for astrophysical reasons). In this work, we relax these prior assumptions and model the spin distributions using a more data-driven approach, modeling these distributions with flexible cubic spline interpolants in order to allow for capturing structures that the parametric models cannot. We find that adding this flexibility to the model substantially increases the uncertainty in the inferred distributions, but find a general trend for lower support at high spin magnitude and a spin tilt distribution consistent with isotropic orientations. We infer that 62 - 87\% of black holes have spin magnitudes less than a = 0.5, and 27- 50\% of black holes exhibit negative \${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$. Using the inferred \${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ distribution, we place a conservative upper limit of 37\% for the contribution of hierarchical mergers to the astrophysical BBH population. Additionally, we find that artifacts from unconverged Monte Carlo integrals in the likelihood can manifest as spurious peaks and structures in inferred distributions, mandating the use of a sufficient number of samples when using Monte Carlo integration for population inference.},

This is motivated by scenarios where PBHs in this mass range spin up as they evaporate, namely the string axiverse, where dimensionless spin parameters \${\textbackslash}tilde\{a\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.1-0.5\$ can be achieved through the Hawking emission of hundreds or even thousands of light axion-like particles. Measuring the present PBH mass-spin distribution may thus be an important probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. Since the proposed method relies on the energy of the photons emitted by a given PBH, rather than on the associated flux, it is independent of the PBH-Earth distance and, as a byproduct, can also be used to infer the latter.},

The continuum spectrum is well modelled with an absorbed disk-blackbody plus cutoff power-law, in the hard, intermediate and soft states. In addition, we detect an \${\textbackslash}approx\$6.6 keV Fe emission line in the hard intermediate state. Throughout the soft intermediate and soft states, the fitted inner disk radius remains almost constant; we suggest that it has settled at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, in the hard and hard intermediate states, the apparent inner radius was unphysically small (smaller than ISCO), even after accounting for the Compton scattering of some of the disk photons by the corona in the fit. We argue that this is the result of a high hardening factor, \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm col\}{\textbackslash}approx2.0-2.7\$, in the early phases of outburst evolution, well above the canonical value of 1.7 suitable to a steady disk. We suggest that the inner disk radius was close to ISCO already in the low/hard state. Furthermore, we propose that this high value of hardening factor in the relatively hard state is probably caused by the additional illuminating of the coronal irradiation onto the disk. Additionally, we estimate the spin parameter with the continuum-fitting method, over a range of plausible black hole masses and distances. We compare our results with the spin measured with the reflection-fitting method and find that the inconsistency of the two results is partly caused by the different choices of \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm col\}\$.},

Using a self-consistent Comptonization model, we show that one can analyze spectra that exhibit strong power-law components and obtain values of the inner disk radius, and hence spin, that are consistent with those obtained in the TD state. Specifically, we analyze many RXTE spectra of two BH transients, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564, and we demonstrate that the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk remains constant to within a few percent as the strength of the Comptonized component increases by an order of magnitude, i.e., as the fraction of the thermal seed photons that are scattered approaches 25\%. We conclude that the CF method can be applied to a much wider body of data than previously thought possible, and to sources that have never been observed to enter the TD state (e.g., Cyg X-1)},

	abstract = {During its yearlong outburst in 1975--76, the transient source A0620--00 reached an intensity of 50 Crab, an all-time record for any X-ray binary. The source has been quiescent since. We recently determined accurate values for the black hole mass, orbital inclination angle and distance. Building on these results, we have measured the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk around the black hole primary by fitting its thermal continuum spectrum to our version of the relativistic Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model. We have thereby estimated the spin of the black hole. Although our spin estimate depends on a single high quality spectrum, which was obtained in 1975 by OSO-8, we are confident of our result because of the consistent values of the inner-disk radius that we have obtained for hundreds of observations of other sources: H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, and notably LMC X-3. We have determined the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a*=0.12+/-0.19, with a*{\textless}0.49 and a*{\textgreater}-0.59 at the 3 sigma level of confidence. This result takes into account all sources of observational and model-parameter uncertainties. Despite the low spin, the intensity and properties of the radio counterpart, both in outburst and quiescence, attest to the presence of a strong jet. If jets are driven by black hole spin, then current models indicate that jet power should be a steeply increasing function of a*. Consequently, the low spin of A0620--00 suggests that its jet may be disk-driven.},

	abstract = {The first extragalactic X-ray binary, LMC X-1, was discovered in 1969. In the 1980s, its compact primary was established as the fourth dynamical black-hole candidate. Recently, we published accurate values for the mass of the black hole and the orbital inclination angle of the binary system. Building on these results, we have analyzed 53 X-ray spectra obtained by RXTE and, using a selected sample of 18 of these spectra, we have determined the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a* = 0.92(-0.07,+0.05). This result takes into account all sources of observational and model-parameter uncertainties. The standard deviation around the mean value of a* for these 18 X-ray spectra, which were obtained over a span of several years, is only 0.02. When we consider our complete sample of 53 RXTE spectra, we find a somewhat higher value of the spin parameter and a larger standard deviation. Finally, we show that our results based on RXTE data are confirmed by our analyses of selected X-ray spectra obtained by the XMM-Newton, BeppoSAX and Ginga missions.},

	abstract = {Remarkably, an astrophysical black hole has only two attributes: its mass and its spin angular momentum. Spin is often associated with the exotic behavior that black holes manifest such as the production of relativistic and energetic jets. In this thesis, we advance one of the two primary methods of measuring black hole spin, namely, the continuum-fitting method by (1) improving the methodology; (2) testing two foundational assumptions; and (3) measuring the spins of two stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems. Methodology: We present an empirical model of Comptonization that self-consistently generates a hard power-law component by upscattering thermal accretion disk photons as they traverse a hot corona. We show that this model enables reliable measurements of spin for far more X-ray spectral data and for more sources than previously thought possible. Testing the foundations: First, by an exhaustive study of the X-ray spectra of LMC X-3, we show that the inner radius of its accretion disk is constant over decades and unaffected by source variability. Identifying this fixed inner radius with the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit in general relativity, our findings establish a firm foundation for the measurement of black hole spin. Secondly, we test the customary assumption that the inclination angles of the black-hole's spin axis and the binary's orbital axis are the same; for XTE J1550-564 we show that they are aligned to within 12 degrees by modeling the kinematics of the large-scale jets of this microquasar. Measuring spins: We have made the first accurate continuum-fitting spin measurements of the black hole primaries in H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564. For this latter black hole, we have also measured its spin using the other leading method, namely, modeling the broad red wing of the Fe K-alpha; line. As we show, these two independent measurements of spin are in agreement.},

	abstract = {A black hole of given mass, angular momentum, and charge can have a large number of different unobservable internal configurations which reflect the possible different initial configurations of the matter which collapsed to produce the hole. The logarithm of this number can be regarded as the entropy of the black hole and is a measure of the amount of information about the initial state which was lost in the formation of the black hole. If one makes the hypothesis that the entropy is finite, one can deduce that the black holes must emit thermal radiation at some nonzero temperature. Conversely, the recently derived quantum-mechanical result that black holes do emit thermal radiation at temperature κℏ2πkc, where κ is the surface gravity, enables one to prove that the entropy is finite and is equal to c3A4Gℏ, where A is the surface area of the event horizon or boundary of the black hole. Because black holes have negative specific heat, they cannot be in stable thermal equilibrium except when the additional energy available is less than 1/4 the mass of the black hole. This means that the standard statistical-mechanical canonical ensemble cannot be applied when gravitational interactions are important. Black holes behave in a completely random and time-symmetric way and are indistinguishable, for an external observer, from white holes. The irreversibility that appears in the classical limit is merely a statistical effect., This article appears in the following collections:},

When compared to theoretical flux distribution from the surface of a thin disk surrounding a Kerr black hole, the observed X-ray properties of the Galactic superluminal jet sources, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, strongly suggest that each contains a black hole spinning rapidly in the same direction as the accretion disk. We show, however, that some other black hole binaries with an ultra-soft X-ray component probably harbor only non- or slowly-spinning black holes, and we argue that those with no detectable ultra-soft component above 1-2 keV in their high luminosity state may contain a fast-spinning black hole but with a retrograde disk. Therefore, all classes of known black hole binaries are united within one scheme. Furthermore, we explore the possibility that spectral state transitions in Cyg X-1 are simply due to temporary disk reversal, which can occur in a wind accretion system.},

To obtain a full dynamical model of the binary, we use an extensive collection of optical photometric and spectroscopic data taken from the literature. By using all of the available observational constraints, we show that the orbit is slightly eccentric (both the radial velocity and photometric data independently confirm this result) and that the companion star rotates roughly 1.4 times its pseudosynchronous value. We find a black hole mass of M = 14.8 ± 1.0 M☉, a companion mass of Mopt = 19.2 ± 1.9 M☉, and the angle of inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight of i = 27.1 ± 0.8 deg.},

These black holes are located in two distinct classes of X-ray binary systems, one that is persistently X-ray bright and another that is transient. Both the persistent and transient black holes remain for long periods in a state where their spectra are dominated by a thermal accretion disk component. The spin of a black hole of known mass and distance can be measured by fitting this thermal continuum spectrum to the thin-disk model of Novikov and Thorne; the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of the black hole’s accretion disk. Strong observational and theoretical evidence links the inner-disk radius to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, which is trivially related to the dimensionless spin parameter a∗ of the black hole ({\textbar}a∗{\textbar}{\textless}1). The ten spins that have so far been measured by this continuum-fitting method range widely from a∗≈0 to a∗{\textgreater}0.95. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by the dozens or hundreds of independent and consistent measurements of spin that have been obtained for several black holes, and through careful consideration of many sources of systematic error. Among the results discussed is a dichotomy between the transient and persistent black holes; the latter have higher spins and larger masses. Also discussed is recently discovered evidence in the transient sources for a correlation between the power of ballistic jets and black hole spin.},

We find that Γ is positively and negatively correlated with lX when lX ≳ 10− 3 and 10− 6.5 ≲ lX ≲ 10− 3, respectively, while Γ is nearly a constant when lX ≲ 10− 6.5. We explain the above correlation in the framework of a coupled hot accretion flow–jet model. The radio emission always comes from the jet while the X-ray emission comes from the accretion flow and jet when lX is above and below 10−6.5, respectively. More specifically, we assume that with the increase of mass accretion rate, the hot accretion flow develops into a clumpy and further a disc–corona two-phase structure because of thermal instability. We argue that such kind of two-phase accretion flow can explain the observed positive correlation.},

Here, we perform a few simple tests to establish whether outflows from the disk close to the inner radius can address this problem. We employ four different parametric models to describe the wind and compare these to the apparent decrease in spin with luminosity measured in the sources LMC X-3 and GRS 1915+105. Wind models in which parameters do not explicitly depend on the accretion rate cannot reproduce the spin measurements. Models with mass accretion rate dependent outflows, however, have spectra that emulate the observed ones. The assumption of a wind thus effectively removes the artifact of spin decrease. This solution is not unique; the same conclusion can be obtained using a truncated inner disk model. To distinguish among the valid models, we will need high-resolution X-ray data and a realistic description of the Comptonization in the wind.},

	abstract = {Recently, the system parameters of Cygnus X-1, i.e., the black hole mass M, the orbital inclination i and the source distance D, have been updated. As the input constraints of the continuum-fitting method, it is necessary to refine the spin with these new parameters. The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT, also named Insight) was successfully launched on June 15th, 2017 in China. In this work, we analyzed spectra obtained by the Insight-HXMT during 2017-2018 and re-estimated the spin via the continuum-fitting method. We first re-estimated the spin using old parameters and found the dimensionless spin parameter to be a⁎{\textgreater}0.934 (3σ), which is consistent with previous measurements both from the continuum-fitting and iron-line fitting methods (Gou et al. 2011, Gou et al. 2014; Fabian et al. 2012, Walton et al. 2016, Tomsick et al. 2018). Then, when the new parameters were applied, we obtained an increased spin: a⁎{\textgreater}0.967 (3σ), which is also consistent with the recent measurement (Zhao et al. 2020, submitted to ApJ) and also confirms an extreme Kerr black hole lying in this system.},

	abstract = {Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we have measured a trigonometric parallax for the microquasar GRS 1915+105, which contains a black hole and a K-giant companion. This yields a direct distance estimate of 8.6 +2.0 −1.6 kpc and a revised estimate for the mass of the black hole of 12.4 +2.0 −1.8 M⊙. GRS 1915+105 is at about the same distance as some H II regions and water masers associated with high-mass star formation in the Sagittarius spiral arm of the Galaxy. The absolute proper motion of GRS 1915+105 is −3.19 ± 0.03 mas y−1 and −6.24 ± 0.05 mas y−1 toward the east and north, respectively, which corresponds to a modest peculiar speed of 22 ± 24 km s−1 at the parallax distance, suggesting that the binary did not receive a large velocity kick when the black hole formed. On one observational epoch, GRS 1915+105 displayed superluminal motion along the direction of its approaching jet. Considering previous observations of jet motions, the jet in GRS 1915+105 can be modeled with a jet inclination to the line of sight of 60◦ ± 5 ◦ and a variable flow speed between 0.65c and 0.81c, which possibly indicates deceleration of the jet at distances from the black hole \& 2000 AU. Finally, using our measurements of distance and estimates of black hole mass and inclination, we provisionally confirm our earlier result that the black hole is spinning very rapidly.},

	abstract = {Based on a spectral analysis of the X-ray continuum that employs a fully relativistic accretion disk model, we conclude that the compact primary of the binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 is a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole. We find a lower limit on the dimensionless spin parameter of a*{\textgreater}0.98. Our result is robust in the sense that it is independent of the details of the data analysis and insensitive to the uncertainties in the mass and distance of the black hole. Furthermore, our accretion disk model includes an advanced treatment of spectral hardening. Our data selection relies on a rigorous and quantitative definition of the thermal state of black hole binaries, which we used to screen all of the available RXTE and ASCA data for the thermal state of GRS 1915+105. In addition, we focus on those data for which the accretion disk luminosity is less than 30\% of the Eddington luminosity. We argue that these low-luminosity data are most appropriate for the thin α-disk model that we employ. We assume that there is zero torque at the inner edge of the disk, as is likely when the disk is thin, although we show that the presence of a significant torque does not affect our results. Our model and the model of the relativistic jets observed for this source constrain the distance and black hole mass and could thus be tested by determining a VLBA parallax distance and improving the measurement of the mass function. Finally, we comment on the significance of our results for relativistic jet and core-collapse models and for the detection of gravitational waves.},

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field. The present concepts are applied to a model of an active galactic nucleus containing a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk.},

	abstract = {GRS 1915+105 is a transient black hole X-ray binary consistently emitting 10-100\% of the Eddington luminosity in the X-ray band during the last three decades until mid-2018 when the source luminosity suddenly decreased by an order of magnitude. This phase was followed by a change to a state with even lower average X-ray fluxes never seen before during the outburst but presenting renewed flaring activity at different wavelengths. Nevertheless, the mean fluxes were still in decline. GRS 1915+105 has the longest orbital period known among low-mass X-ray binaries, the largest accretion disk size, and therefore the largest mass supply for accretion. The high inclination of the disk allows the study of geometrical effects of the accretion flow such as changes in the height-to-radius ratio or the effect of accretion disk winds on the intrinsic emission that are expected during the outburst decay. In addition, the transient jet is expected to change to a compact, self-absorbed, steady jet. We conducted two full polarization Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations to study the jet properties during the outburst decay by analyzing the spectral, polarization, and intra-epoch variability for both observation epochs. In addition, we analyzed nearly daily Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer pointing observations consisting of modeling X-ray power spectral densities, spectral energy distributions, and lightcurves with a physically motivated model to follow the changing accretion disk properties throughout the outburst decay and relating them to the jet emission. We show that the X-ray and mm spectral, timing, and polarization properties are consistent with those of a typical decaying X-ray binary outburst and that GRS 1915+105 has descended into the low-luminosity hard X-ray state.},
